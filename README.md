# Simulation1

Two Unity simulations where audio and/or video are transformed to graphic effects. Also I played a lot with PostFX effects and Anamorphic lens flare effects.

## ST1 scene

Simulation where a dancer it's dancing and his body gets voxelized. Also the ground gets displaced following the amplitude from the song of the scene.

## ST2 scene

Simulation where data is readed from video (up to the right) and is transformed into voxels following the video pattern.
